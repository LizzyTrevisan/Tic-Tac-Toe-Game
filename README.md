TIC TAC TOE

## Overview
This Tic Tac Toe game is a classic implementation of the popular two-player game where players alternate turns placing either an "X" or an "O" on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first player to align three of their marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. This project features a user-friendly interface built using Windows Forms, allowing for easy gameplay and interaction.

## Features
Two-Player Mode: Players can take turns to place their marks on the board.
Win Detection: The game checks for a winner after each turn, declaring the winner with a message box.
Draw Detection: If all spaces are filled without a winner, a message box will announce a draw.
Reset Game: Players can easily start a new game without restarting the application.
Resizable Window: The form is designed to be resizable, with buttons that adjust to maintain a clean layout.

## Technologies Used
C#: The primary programming language used for application logic.

Windows Forms: For the graphical user interface, providing a responsive and interactive experience.
